        <h2>Target Audience</h2>

        <p>
            Our target audience includes business owners who are above the age of 18. We expect that most visitors to this site will be using smaller devices such as smartphones.
            So, the website is going to be optimized to work well regardless of the user's viewport size.
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of HCOC is to help business owners from Hyderabad. The site will provide a list of services offered by HCOC. Each service will have a dedicated page
            of its own which will contain detailed information pertaining to that service.
        </p>

        <p>
            The site will also feature a B2B portal using which business owners can connect to other businesses in the city. Business owners can use this portal to advertise
            products and services offered by them.
        </p>

        <p>The site will also provide a contact form using which visitors can contact us for any queries with ease.</p>

        <p>The site will also have a blog that will contain articles related to various business sectors. The blog will also feature upcoming trade shows and training programs.</p>
